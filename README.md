# PatchPatterns
Computer Science Introduction To Programming first coursework

As a first coursework for the INTPROG unit in CS 1 we've been asked to make patches with patterns
chosen by our student id number, so nobody did the same coursework.
There are two levels to it, the first one is to make the patches and to display them in a certain order 
(ex. mines are in a ladder order), the advanced one was to swap patches at click events.
I had a very saddisfying first class grade on this even though I might make some slight changes to clean the code a little bit.
